# prometheus_simple_checks

A set of prometheus textfile exporter scripts that you can easily use.

You may download the imports before or just compile it into a binary. Either way it works

Maybe you do not wish to download an entire exporter and use a simple and easily maintainable script. So feel free to use them.
